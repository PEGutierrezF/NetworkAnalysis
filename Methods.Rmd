## Function setup ->  graph_from_data_frame()
1) We used 'directed = False' (this is Undirected network) since Source (main author) and Target (co-authors) are not meaningful.

Directed and Undirected definition:

Many papers on coauthorship analysis use Undirected network:

1- Azondekon, R., Harper, Z. J., Agossa, F. R., Welzig, C. M., & McRoy, S. (2018). Scientific authorship and collaboration network analysis on malaria research in Benin: papers indexed in the web of science (1996–2016). Global Health Research and Policy, 3(1), 1-11.

## Find duplicate in a column 
duplicated(df$column)

## Centrality


## Homophily
Values less than 1 indicate stronger subgroup cohesion than would be expected in a random network (i.e., homophily), and values higher than 1 represent higher than expected rates of collaboration (i.e., heterophily).
